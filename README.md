## About Me

I work at the intersection of **crypto trading, blockchain development, and on-chain research**, with a strong focus on understanding **market structure rather than surface-level price action**.

My core interest lies in **how capital, leverage, and positioning drive crypto markets**. I actively study and analyze:

- Spot vs perpetual futures dynamics
- Funding rates, basis trades, and trader positioning
- Open interest, liquidations, and volatility expansion/compression
- BTC dominance, correlation regimes, and why altcoins structurally follow Bitcoin

Rather than treating trading as isolated chart patterns, I approach it as a **system shaped by incentives, liquidity, and derivatives mechanics**.

On the technical side, I build **Ethereum-based tools and Web3 applications**, working with:

- Solidity and smart contract fundamentals
- Remix and Hardhat for development and testing
- JavaScript, React, and Node.js for dashboards and interfaces
- Web3/Ethers libraries for on-chain data interaction

A recurring theme in my work is **turning complex crypto data into usable insight**. This has led me to design and plan:

- Crypto screeners and market dashboards
- Market regime journals for daily tracking
- Educational resources that explain funding, open interest, and correlation clearly

Beyond individual building and trading, I’m also interested in the **community layer of Web3** — how traders, builders, and researchers can collaborate, learn, and contribute on-chain. I care deeply about **education, transparency, and long-term skill development** in the crypto space.

Overall, my goal is simple but demanding:
**to develop strong market intuition backed by data, and to build tools that help others understand how crypto markets actually work.**
