**Blockchain Engineer · Smart Contract Security · Protocol & Systems Research**

## Overview

I build and research **decentralized systems** with a focus on **smart contract security, protocol design, and system-level behavior**. My work spans DeFi infrastructure, on-chain research, and execution-layer architecture—helping Web3 products move from concept to **production-grade, adversary-resilient systems**.

I care less about whether code compiles and more about whether systems **remain secure, live, and incentive-aligned under real-world conditions**.

Beyond engineering, I contribute to developer and crypto communities by breaking down complex protocol ideas and sharing practical insights on security, DeFi mechanics, and blockchain infrastructure.
